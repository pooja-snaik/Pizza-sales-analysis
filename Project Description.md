### Project Description: Pizza Sales Analysis Using SQL  

This project demonstrates a comprehensive analysis of pizza sales using SQL, leveraging real-world data to gain actionable insights into business performance. The analysis utilizes four interrelated tables and includes a variety of SQL queries ranging from basic to advanced levels. Key highlights of the analysis include:  

1. **Percentage Contribution of Each Pizza Type to Total Revenue**  
   - Analyzed the share of each pizza type in the overall revenue, providing insights into the most profitable products.

2. **Top 3 Most Ordered Pizza Types by Revenue per Category**  
   - Identified the top-performing pizzas in each category (e.g., vegetarian, non-vegetarian) based on their revenue contribution.  

3. **Order Distribution by Hour of the Day**  
   - Examined the hourly order patterns to determine peak times for customer orders, aiding in workforce optimization and promotional strategies.

4. **Cumulative Revenue Analysis Over Time**  
   - Tracked how revenue accumulates over a specified period, highlighting trends and seasonality in customer spending behavior.  

### Dataset Overview  

The analysis is powered by four key tables:  
- **Orders**: Contains details of customer orders, including order ID, timestamps, and customer information.  
- **Pizzas**: Holds details about pizza types, categories, and their prices.  
- **Order Details**: Captures the specifics of each order, such as the quantity and type of pizzas ordered.  
- **Customers**: Includes customer demographics and location data to support segmentation analysis.  

### Techniques and SQL Concepts  

This project showcases the use of diverse SQL techniques and concepts, including:  
- Basic queries: Data extraction, filtering, and sorting.  
- Aggregations: SUM, COUNT, AVG, and GROUP BY to summarize data.  
- Window functions: RANK, ROW_NUMBER, and CUME_DIST for advanced insights.  
- Joins: Combining data across multiple tables for comprehensive analysis.  
- Subqueries and CTEs: Structuring complex queries for readability and efficiency.  
- Date and time functions: Analyzing trends based on timestamps.  
- Dynamic calculations: Metrics like percentage contributions and cumulative totals.  

### Outcome  

The insights derived from this analysis are instrumental in identifying high-performing products, understanding customer behavior, and optimizing operational strategies. This project is a robust example of leveraging SQL for data-driven decision-making in the food and beverage industry.
